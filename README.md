this repo is about my personal config, simple but handy

# .vimrc

nothing to say, no plugins, just configuration

> i will not let vim manage my project, vim is used for edit, simple data filer

# .zshrc

first, you need a zsh

> i am 100% sure that, linux distro's packet manager includes zsh

second, you need oh-my-zsh, this one need to be cloned from github official page, [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

> you can just google oh-my-zsh and run the download command in you terminal
> 
> but you may blocked by GFW(:sad:), in this case, you may:
> * config proxy for curl(may works, but i haven't try)
> * config proxy for git, and run install.sh from github repo page

zsh contains many plugins, some are useful, some just pretty, all the config are included in .zshrc

> [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a theme of zsh, .p10k.zsh is used to config terminal layout

# themeable

this .css file is used for typora theme

> deep, dark, fantasy

these files need to be placed at: `C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\Typora\themes`

> you can enter this directory from typora itself (it contains a theme configuration, just enter)
